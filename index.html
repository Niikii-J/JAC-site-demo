                                They brought a high level of professionalism to the event planning and execution. And provided courteous staff to ensure the success of the event. There were 66 countries with over 2,000 persons present and tens of thousands of dollars in support broadcast and tournament equipment. They were in charge of all aspects of security and were able to deliver a quality event.

                                I am pleased to have the opportunity to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of James Carey and Associates.<br><br>

                                During their tenure with TMAC Consultancy, they established themselves as I trusted security services partner, exhibiting levels of services which exceeded expectations.<br><br>

                                Furthermore, The Albany Heroes Tournament provided them the stage to showcase themselves as global players in the provision of Security Services. As Sr. Vice President at Albany at the time, I bore witness to their detailed planning, implementation and follow up, in addition to their laser focus on critical issues which enabled the event to flow seamlessly.<br><br>

                                James Carey and Associates currently supervises over five million dollars’ worth of equipment on behalf of Golden Heavy Equipment at the New Providence Ecology Park (Bahamas landfill). The company is motivated, disciplined, and professional, demonstrating a high degree of integrity.<br><br>

                                As such, I recommended the services of James Carey and Associates without reservation.

                                Thus far, the working relationship between Carey &amp; Associates and The University of The Bahamas is on one accord and a clear understanding has been established. The company is always willing to assist, and has assisted us for the past three (3) years with our Graduation ceremonies, as well as Charter Day 2016, which were held at the Thomas A.
